# ArduOS (Runtime for Arduino Uno)

This repository contains code for the ArduOS runtime and is to be flashed on compatible devices to run programs in the `ArduOS bytecode` format.

## The boot process
1. Display a simple bootscreen with the ArduOS name and the runtime version
2. Try to access the SD card, prompt the user to insert one, if it can't be accessed
3. Load and display a boot logo from the SD card instead of text (`/ARDUOS.BMP`)
4. Create a sufficiently sized memory-file for the runtime, if it doesn't already exist (file size: 128 MiB)\
*Note:* It is recommended to create this file on your PC and save it to the SD card. File creation did not work as expected on my machine. To create the memfile on Windows, use the following command (tested in PowerShell): `fsutil file createnew MEM0.MEM 134217728`
5. Run `/SYS/BOOT.RUN` from the SD card
6. If the runtime ever reaches the end-of-file of an executable, it will run `/SYS/HOME.RUN`

### Required system files

*Note:* If any of the required system files cannot be found, the device will display a message starting with `FATAL ERROR` and you will need to reset the device in order to restart the system. So, make sure that these files are present on your SD card. Required system files are:
* /ARDUOS.BMP
* /SYS/BOOT.RUN
* /SYS/HOME.RUN

## Registers and memory

### Endianness

ArduOS uses **little-endian** (least significant byte followed by most significant byte).

### Registers

The ArduOS runtime emulates 31 general-purpose registers from R0 to R31. In addition to that, R32 and R33 both contain the least- and most significant bytes of the stack-pointer respectively. All registers have a size of 16-bits each.

### Memory

The ArduOS runtime also emulates 128 MiB of RAM with addresses up to 0x3FFFFFF, containing two bytes each. Data in memory is written to and read from a memfile (usually `/MEM0.MEM`).

## ArduOS bytecode format

A valid ArduOS bytecode file must meet the following requirements:
* A filename ending in `.RUN`
* Its contents starting with 15 bytes reading `ArduOS bytecode`, followed by two bytes indicating the version number of the bytecode language used in the file
* A list of instructions starting at byte no. 17 (counting starts at zero)
  * Each instruction has a length of 4 bytes.
  * The first byte of the instruction specifies the instruction, the following 3 bytes are to be used for arguments.

The `res` folder contains a list of [instructions](res/instruction_set.pdf) and [system variables](res/sysvars.pdf) both in PDF and Excel-formats. (These same tables can be found below)
